# GEO to DXF Converter

This project is a simple Python converter that transforms GEO files (in Trumpf format) into DXF files (R12). The program reads data about points, lines, arcs, and circles from a GEO file and writes them into a DXF file while preserving color information.

## Features

- **Points:** Reads point coordinates marked with `P`.
- **Lines:** Converts `LIN` elements into DXF `LINE` entities.
- **Arcs:** Converts `ARC` elements into DXF `ARC` entities. The start angle, end angle, and radius are calculated based on the coordinates.
- **Circles:** Converts `CIR` elements into DXF `CIRCLE` entities.
- **Coloring:** The color of each entity is determined by the parameter line in the GEO file. If the parameter line contains token `2` or `3`, the color is set to yellow (2); otherwise, the default color (7) is used.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**  
  The main entry point of the application. It takes command-line arguments for the input GEO file and the output DXF file and initiates the conversion process.

- **parse_geo.py**  
  This module is responsible for reading and parsing the GEO file. The `parse_geo` function extracts points, lines, arcs, and circles from the file.

- **write_dxf.py**  
  This module generates the DXF file. The `write_dxf` function creates the corresponding DXF entities based on the parsed data (points, lines, arcs, circles).

- **README.md**  
  This file contains the project description and usage instructions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer

## Usage

Run the converter by passing the GEO file and the desired DXF output file as command-line arguments. For example:

```bash
python main.py input_file.geo output_file.dxf
```

## How It Works
### 1. Parsing the GEO File
  The parse_geo.py module processes the GEO file by identifying different sections:

- Points Section (marker #~31): Reads lines containing the command P, followed by a point ID and its coordinates.
- Edges Section (marker #~331): Reads commands:
  - LIN – extracts the point IDs that form a line.
  - ARC – extracts the center point ID, start point ID, end point ID, and arc direction.
  - CIR – extracts the center point ID and the circle’s radius.

The entity color is determined by checking if the parameter line includes tokens 2 or 3.

### 2. Generating the DXF File
  The write_dxf.py module uses the parsed data to write DXF entities:

- LINE: Creates DXF LINE entities for LIN elements.
- ARC: Computes the necessary arc parameters (start angle, end angle, and radius) and generates DXF ARC entities.
- CIRCLE: Generates DXF CIRCLE entities for CIR elements, using the center point and radius.

All entities include color information (DXF group code 62).
